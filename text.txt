KINEMATICS
- forward/inverse kinematics
- deegrees of freedom
- DH Tables
- Rotation Matrices, Jacobian matrices
- types of joints: rotary, prismatic, serial. parallel
- teach programming: manually perform robot task
- accuracy vs repeatability, bell curve
    - aim for well calibrated, repeatable robot

PROGRAMMING
- Online vs Offline Programming

SENSORS
- force and torque (contact based)
- vision
- haptic feedback (medical applications)

MOBILE ROBOTS
- optimize infrastrucutre:
    - paint lines, guide wires, rails,reflective beacons, QR Tags, 

CONTROLLERS and CONNECTIONS
- WiFi, EtherNet, ROS,bus etc.
- robot controllers
- wireless and wired protocols are standardized
- home WiFi is optimized for speed. (high bandwidth)
- industrial networks mut be REAL TIME
    - send low data packets, high frequency, low latency

ROS 
- distributions are alphabetically named!

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
- source code management
    - version control, issue tracking, concurrent development
    - git, github, gitlab, bitbucket

- Continuous Integration (CI)
    - merge and build source code continuously
    - build and test code autonomusly
    - jenkins, travis

- Virtualizationi
    - virtul machines, emulate system on a faster machines
    - Docker, VirtualBox, Unix Chroot

- CLoud Computing
    - run server somewhere on the internet externally
    - edge computing, fog computing
    - Container, VM, amazon web services

- Pair Programming
    - assistants to help programmers
    - Github CoPilot, OpenAI, Intellicode, IDEs

MANIPULATOR
- end-effector:
    - vacuum, clawgrippers
- tactile sensing to detect textures (fruit picking)
- grasping decisions are real time 
- wrist-mounted force sensing

SOFT ROBOTICS
- air and fluids
